@sa_disrupt

The <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazi</span> <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**SA**</span> has disrupted our rally! Their street troops are preventing us from meeting.

- @police_protect: Call the police to protect our rally.
- @rb_protect: Use the Reichsbanner to protect our rally.
- @both_protect: The police and Reichsbanner should work together to protect our rally.
- @cancel: Cancel the rally.

@police_protect_win

The police successfully protected our rally, so it can go ahead as usual.

@police_protect_lose
on-arrival: workers_nsdap += 3; strife += 1

Unfortunately, the police were unable or unwilling to hold back the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**SA**</span> mob. The <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazis</span> have won this show of strength.

@rb_protect_win

The Reichsbanner has successfully protected our rally against the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**SA**</span>! Our meeting can go ahead as usual.

@rb_protect_lose
on-arrival: workers_nsdap += 3; rb_strength -= 50

Unfortunately, the Reichsbanner was not able to hold back the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**SA**</span> mob. The <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazis</span> have won this show of strength.

@main_rally

Mass rallies are a common feature of <span style="color: #c00000;">social democratic</span> life, especially in the lead-up to an election. What is the primary theme of this rally?

- @class_struggle: The class struggle of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie.
- @welfare: Sozialpolitik - the maintenance and expansion of social welfare programs.
- @democracy: Expanding our nascent democracy and defending it against <span style="color: #808080;">dictatorship</span> and <span style="color: #7A3C00;">fascism</span>.
- @pacifism: Opposing war, nationalism, and militarism at all costs.
- @wtb: Support the WTB plan!
- @local: A mixture of various local and national concerns that resonate most with the audience.
- @easy_discard

@class_struggle
on-arrival: workers_spd += 4*(1-dissent); workers_spd += 2*(1-dissent) if nationalization_adopted; unemployed_spd += 2*(1-dissent) if nationalization_adopted; unemployed_spd += 3*(1-dissent) if left_strength > reformist_strength; workers_spd += 4*(1-dissent) if nationalization_progress > 0; unemployed_spd += 3*(1-dissent) if nationalization_progress > 0; left_strength += 5; left_dissent -= 5; old_middle_spd -= 3; new_middle_spd -= 2; dvp_right += 0.5; ddp_right += 0.5; lvp_right += 0.5

Our message of class struggle appeals to the left wing of the working class, while potentially alienating the middle class. [? if nationalization_adopted :  The adoption of the Left’s nationalization plan has done much to revitalize worker enthusiasm. ?][? if nationalization_progress > 0 : Our achievements in nationalization have assisted our messaging. ?]

@welfare
on-arrival: workers_spd += 3*(1-dissent); workers_spd += 3*(1-dissent) if welfare > 0; unemployed_spd += 3*(1-dissent) if welfare > 0; unemployed_spd += 4*(1-dissent) if welfare > 1; reformist_strength += 3; labor_strength += 4; reformist_dissent -= 3; labor_dissent -= 3;

The reformist message appeals to the organized workers, whose benefits are the accomplishments of <span style="color: #c00000;">social democracy</span>. [? if welfare > 1 : Our achievements in expanding welfare have made this message more effective. ?]

@democracy
on-arrival: democratization += 1; pro_republic += 3*(1 - dissent); workers_spd += 2*(1-dissent) if democratization >= 3; unemployed_spd += 1*(1-dissent) if democratization >= 3; new_middle_spd += 2*(1-dissent) if democratization >= 3; ddp_left += 0.5 if pro_republic >= 70; lvp_left += 0.5 if pro_republic >= 70

Our speakers defend the <span style="color: #000000;">rep</span><span style="color: #DD0000;">ubl</span><span style="color: #FFCC00;">ican</span> system and rail against the <span style="color: #808080;">monarchists</span> and <span style="color: #7A3C00;">authoritarians</span> who threaten it.

[? if democratization < 3 : Talk of democracy does not excite the workers as much as more practical issues. But that may change; part of our job is to provide political education to the proletariat. ?]
[? if democratization >= 3 : Since we have consistently made democratization a theme of our campaign, the workers are enthusiastic about our message. ?]

@pacifism
on-arrival: pacifism += 1; nationalism -= 3*(1 - dissent); workers_spd += 2*(1 - dissent) if pacifism >= 3; unemployed_spd += 1*(1-dissent) if pacifism >= 3; nationalism -= 3*(1-dissent) if pacifism >= 3; new_middle_spd += 2*(1-dissent) if pacifism >= 3; ddp_left += 0.5 if (pacifism >= 3 and nationalism <= 50)

Our speakers denounce the military establishment and all the spending entering that black hole. Some adventurous speakers question the responsibility of the military elites in organizing the Great War.

[? if pacifism < 3 : Given the volume of nationalist indoctrination in our society, it is difficult to argue so vehemently against the military. ?]
[? if pacifism >= 3 : Since we have consistently made pacifism a theme of our campaign, the workers are enthusiastic about our message. ?]

@wtb
view-if: wtb_adopted = 1
choose-if: return_to_normalcy = 0 and (wtb_implemented >= wtb_rally or (not spd_in_government and not spd_toleration))
unavailable-subtitle: [? if return_to_normalcy == 1: The economic crisis is largely over now, and the public is no longer interested in hearing about it. ?] [? if wtb_rally > wtb_implemented: Rhetoric alone has its limits; further implementation of the WTB plan is necessary to continue an effective campaign. ?]
on-arrival: workers_spd += 3*(1-dissent); unemployed_spd += 3*(1-dissent); rural_spd += 1*(1-dissent); new_middle_spd += 1*(1-dissent); old_middle_spd += 1*(1-dissent); workers_spd += 3*(1-dissent) if wtb_implemented; unemployed_spd += 3*(1-dissent) if wtb_implemented; rural_spd += 2*(1-dissent) if wtb_implemented; new_middle_spd += 2*(1-dissent) if wtb_implemented; old_middle_spd += 2*(1-dissent) if wtb_implemented; wtb_rally += 1

The WTB plan has become a popular rallying cry for our party. The workers are eager to go back to work, and that is exactly what the plan promises. [? if not wtb_implemented: However, many still believe that the plan is merely an empty slogan and will remain skeptical until we actually implement it. ?]


@local
on-arrival: workers_spd += 3*(1-dissent); old_middle_spd += 1*(1-dissent); new_middle_spd += 2*(1-dissent); unemployed_spd += 3*(1-dissent);

Our speakers have gauged the mood and are speaking to the issues that seem to most affect the workers in this moment.
